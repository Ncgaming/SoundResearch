This code is really rough.  It was used for several examples, so you need to strategically
comment/uncomment various calls in viewDidLoad or setUpAUConnectionsWithRenderCallback to
get various code paths working.

Please check http://www.subfurther.com/blog in May 2010 for a nicer version.

Thanks for attending 360iDev!
