This code is really rough.  Please check http://www.subfurther.com/blog in 
May 2010 for a nicer version.

Also, the sound file "Girlfriend.caf" has been removed. Y'know, unauthorized
duplication and everything.  Feel free to replace this with an uncompressed
song (that you own).  You can use /usr/bin/afconvert to convert MP3 and AAC files
into uncompressed (PCM) .wav's, .aif's, and .caf's.

Thanks for attending 360iDev!
